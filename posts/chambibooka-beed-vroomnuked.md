  **Chorus**  
  Grandma got run over by a reindeer  
  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve  
  You can say there's no such thing as Santa  
  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe  

  She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog  
  And we'd begged her not to go  
  But she forgot her medication  
  And she staggered out the door into the snow  
  When we found her Christmas mornin'  
  At the scene of the attack  
  She had hoof prints on her forehead  
  And incriminatin' hoof marks on her back  

  [Chorus]

  Now we're all so proud of Grandpa  
  He's been takin' this so well  
  See him in there watchin' football  
  Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle  
  It's not Christmas without Grandma  
  All the family's dressed in black  
  And we just can't help but wonder:  
  Should we open up her gifts or send them back?  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Now the goose is on the table  
  And the pudding made of fig  
  And a blue and silver candle  
  That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig  
  I've warned all my friends and neighbors  
  "Better watch out for yourselves.  
  They should never give a license  
  To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves."  
  
  [Chorus But Different]  
  Sing it, Grandpa!  
  Grandma got run over by a reindeer  
  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve  
  (Minding her own business)  
  You can say there's no such thing as Santa  
  (What do you mean there's no Santa?)  
  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe  
  Sing it, Grandpa!
