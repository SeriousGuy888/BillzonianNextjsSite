  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
  Just like the ones I used to know  
  Where the tree tops glisten  
  And children listen  
  To hear sleigh bells in the snow, oh the snow  

  I said, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
  With every Christmas card I write  
  May your days be merry and bright  
  And may all your Christmases be white

  With every Christmas card I write  
  May your days, may your days, may your days  
  Be merry and bright  
  And may all your Christmas' be white
