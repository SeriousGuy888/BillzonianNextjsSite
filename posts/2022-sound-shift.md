I would like to make Billzonian become substantially different from English in 2022.

This page lists some proposed sound shifts, like those that occur to natural languages. Sounds in certain environments systematically shift to new sounds.

In addition, new vocabulary shall be coined to replace English vocabulary.

*This page uses [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) for phonemic transcription, (indicated with forward slashes, eg: /bakalaˈɹatʃi/). [Here](http://ipa-reader.xyz/) is a website to read the IPA notation for you if you cannot read it.*

## Palatalisation

[Palatalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(sound_change)) is a sound change where the place of articulation of a phoneme changes to the palate. This is the same process through which Latin's C and G came to be pronounced differently when before the letters I and E when it started to [change into the Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages#Palatalization).

**In this proposed Billzonian sound shift:**
- `/hj/` and `/hi/` mutate to `/ʃ/`, reflected in spelling as `sh`.
- `/kj/` mutates to `/tʃ/`, reflected in spelling as `ch`.

**Examples**
> `hyume` /ˈhjum/ "human, person"  
> → `shoom` /ˈʃum/

> `hir` /ˈhiɹ/ "here"  
> → `shir` /ˈʃiɹ/

> `hue` /ˈhju/ "hue"  
> → `shue` /ˈʃu/

> `dokyument` /ˈdɔkjumənt/ "document"  
> → `dotchument` /ˈdɔtʃumənt/  
> \
> `dokyume` /ˈdɔkjum/ "to document; to record"  
> → `dotchu` /ˈdɔtʃu/

## Simplification of Word-Final Cluster /kt/ to /k/
Final /kt/ as in `vikt` becomes /k/, reflected in spelling as `vik`.

- `vikt` → `vik` "to win"
  - `vikteur` → `vikkeur`
  - `viktion` → `vikment`
- `insekt` → `insek` "bug, glitch"
  - `insektful` → `insekful`
- `affekt` → `affek` "to affect; to feel (emotionally); to emote"
  - `affektion` → `affekment`
  - `effekt` → `effek`
- `detekt` → `detek` "detect"
- `kakt` → `kak` "cactus"
  - `kaktes` → `kaks`

__Special Cases__
- `konstrukt` → `trut` /ˈtʃɹʌt/
- `akt` does not change.

## Irregular Shortening of Words Ending in /aɪɹ/
- `aspire` → `ar` /ˈɑɹ/ "to hope (for)"
- `admire` → `mire` /ˈmaɪɹ/ "to admire"
- `desire` → `dzar` /ˈdzɑɹ/ "to want"
  - `desirement` → `dzarment` /ˈdzɑɹmənt/

## Respelling of "Interestsome"
The word `interestsome` is far more commonly used than its stem, `interest`.
It therefore makes sense to respell it without the silent T, since the original word is almost never used.
Maybe the silent Es should also be removed 🤔🤔🤔  
`interestsome` → `interessome` /ˈɪntʃɹɛsəm/
