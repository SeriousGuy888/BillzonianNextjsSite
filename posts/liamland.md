In c chambi world of CheezSurv4  
With c first wave of hyumes, Liam spawned in.

Post nuking trees, Liam konstrukted a boat.  
Jambily, they would row, row, zel row.

An island zel Liam had enhealthed their mission.  
Desisting on c island, Liam faktured aggression.  
Kovered with oak trees zel surrounded by water.  
Liam ak kogged tu reg have so slaughtered.

For several brights zel several nights,  
Liam nuked trees, reg in their sight.

They plundered qwile c sky thundered,  
Howf Liam unk ever blundered.  
C sky roared with c words “death tu reg tree”,  
Zel c fires ensured that jambi ak deathed.

Nearkurr Liamland had a faktory,  
Wun qwich qwite dastardly beed.

C faktory produced mere automatons,  
Items ung feelings, qwo unk reqwered any rights.  
Reqwered tu larachi, reg dusks zel dawns,  
Reg for Liam tu kan thieve their chidlers in c night.

So villagers beed placed in Liam their slave kave.

Jambi attempted evasions zel beed loked by Liam, kruel zel depraved.  
Zel they beed punished mercilessly, buried alive in their graves.
